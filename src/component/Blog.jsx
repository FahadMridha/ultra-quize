                <p>
                    <span className='font-semibold'>Answer:</span> <br /> React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components.

                <p>
                    <span className='font-semibold'>Answer:</span> <br />The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

                    <span className='font-semibold'>Answer:</span> <br />
                    The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
                    useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument ( initialValue ). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property. <br />
                    useState returns 2 properties or an array. One is the value or state and the other is the function to update the state. In contrast, useRef returns only one value which is the actual data stored. When the reference value is changed, it is updated without the need to refresh or re-render.
